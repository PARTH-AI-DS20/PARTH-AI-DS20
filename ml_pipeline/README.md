# ML Pipeline  (Level 0)

This project demonstrates my foundational Git & GitHub skills, including version control, branching, collaboration workflow, and repository management. Itâ€™s the first step in my MLOps learning journey.This repository will evolve as I progress through MLOps levels, with each level adding new features and complexity.


At *Level 0*, it demonstrates:

- Config files (config.yaml)
- Logging (console + file)
- Clean folder structure
- CLI execution


```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
python src/main.py --config config/config.yaml
